Thank you for downloading CMike 0.1.0, a MikeOS 4.6 compatible operating system!

This isn't a stable release, but software should *kinda* work. MikeBASIC
interpreter and writing to files aren't supported. Expect a lot of bugs. :^)

As there are no finished userspace programs written for CMike, you have to
resort to running your own software, or programs included with MikeOS. This
archive should come with load_with_mikeos_software.sh script, which will
download MikeOS 4.6.1, build its userspace and copy the binaries to cmike.flp
when executed. Its dependencies are listed in a comment at the top of the file.

Have a nice day!
