# CMike
CMike is an operating system written in C (and a tiny, tiny bit of supporting Assembly), which aims to be binarily compatible with [MikeOS](http://mikeos.sourceforge.net/) 4.6

You can download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/Mcpg/cmike/releases) section of this repository. The project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). Current version is **0.1.0**.

## System requirements
Exactly the same as MikeOS:
 * a 386 class PC
 * 192 KiB of system memory
 * CGA or compatible
 * a keyboard
 * a floppy disk for boot (for now there are problems with booting off hard drives)

Software might require additional things, but this list is everything necessary for just CMike.

## Usage
Unlike MikeOS, CMike only comes with a command line prompt. It's simple to use, run `help` to list available commands and if you want to execute a binary file, type its full name (including the extension) and press Enter.

## Build
In order to build CMike you need:
 * [ia16-elf toolchain](https://github.com/tkchia/build-ia16)
 * nasm
 * mtools
 * make
 * qemu for `make run`

There's a Makefile in the root of this repository. It supports the following targets:
 * `make all` - build everything, including the disk image
 * `make bootloader` - NatLoader, boot sector used by CMike
 * `make kernel` - the kernel, obviously
 * `make libcmike` - front end library for MikeOS/CMike C programs
 * `make programs` - CMike software
 * `make diskimg` - build the floppy disk image (diskimg/cmike.flp)
 * `make run` - runs QEMU with diskimg/cmike.flp in floppy drive A: and PC speaker enabled
 * `make dist` prepare a cmike-VERSION.tar.gz archive with cmike.flp, all files from misc directory and LICENSE

Have fun. <3
